# The First Tech Coyotes Website

Welcome to the web page for FTC Team 6406, First Tech Coyotes!
This project is built using TypeScript, React, Vite, and Tailwind.

## Gettings started

After cloning the directory, run `npm install`. It will install the necessary packages.
Do not touch the `gh-pages` branch. That is where our website is deployed.

## Previewing

When previewing your changes, run `npm run dev`. It will update the website every time you change the code.

## Building

To build and deploy the website, run `npm run deploy` from the [root directory(./)](./).

> [!Warning]
> Do _not_ deploy the website until you are done with your changes and are ready for them to be made public.
> Learned the hard way.
